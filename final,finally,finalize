Theory Question: What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize() in Java?
Answer:
In Java, final, finally, and finalize() are different concepts though they sound similar.
final
final is a keyword
Used to restrict modification
Can be applied to variables, methods, and classes
Examples:
final variable → value cannot be changed
final method → cannot be overridden
final class → cannot be inherited
finally
finally is a block
Used with try-catch
Always executes whether an exception occurs or not
Mainly used for resource cleanup
Example:
try {
    int a = 10 / 2;
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute");
}
finalize()
finalize() is a method
Called by Garbage Collector
Used before an object is destroyed to perform cleanup activities
Not guaranteed when it will be called
Conclusion:
Keyword	Type	Purpose
final	Keyword	Restricts modification
finally	Block	Executes code regardless of exception
finalize()	Method	Cleanup before object destruction
