Garbage Collection in Java
Garbage Collection (GC) in Java is a process by which the JVM automatically frees memory by removing objects 
that are no longer in use. When objects are created inside a program, they are stored in the heap memory. If an object is not referenced by 
any part of the program, it becomes useless. Garbage Collector identifies such objects and deletes them to make memory available for future objects.
Why Garbage Collection is needed?
To avoid memory leaks
To efficiently use heap memory
To improve program performance
To manage memory automatically without developer effort
How Garbage Collection works?
JVM continuously monitors objects in the heap:
If no active reference is pointing to an object, JVM marks it as eligible for garbage collection
The Garbage Collector removes those unused objects and reclaims memory
Java uses different algorithms for garbage collection like Mark and Sweep, Copying, and Generational GC.
Explicit Request for GC
Developers can request garbage collection using:
System.gc();
But this is not guaranteed because JVM decides the best time to run the Garbage Collector.
Finalization (Deprecated Concept)
Before deleting an object, GC used to call a special method called:
protected void finalize()
But now, it is deprecated in modern Java versions due to performance issues.
