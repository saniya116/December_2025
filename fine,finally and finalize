Theory Answer: Difference between final, finally, and finalize() in Java
1.final (Keyword)
final is a modifier in Java used to restrict the user in different ways.
Uses of final:
1. final variable – value cannot be changed
final int x = 10; 
2. final method – cannot be overridden
class A {
    final void display() {}
}
3. final class – cannot be inherited
final class Test {}
Purpose: To prevent modification.
2️.finally (Block)
finally is used with try–catch blocks.
It always executes whether an exception occurs or not.
Example:
try {
    int a = 10 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Exception handled");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Finally block executed");
}
Purpose: To execute important cleanup code
(like closing files, database connections, etc.)
3️.finalize() (Method)
finalize() is a method defined in Object class, called by the Garbage Collector before an object is destroyed.
Example:
protected void finalize() {
    System.out.println("Object cleaned before deletion");
}
)
