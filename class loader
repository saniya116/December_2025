Java Theory Question
Explain Class Loader in Java and its types
Answer:
In Java, the Class Loader is a part of the JVM responsible for loading class files into memory at runtime. Java follows the principle of “Load classes only when needed”, which is called Lazy Loading.
Class loaders load .class files from different sources like the local file system, JAR files, or the network.
Types of Class Loaders in Java
1. Bootstrap Class Loader
It is the first class loader.
Loads core Java classes such as java.lang, java.util.
Written in native code (C/C++).
Example:
Object, String, System
2.Extension (Platform) Class Loader
Loads classes from the extension libraries.
Path:
jre/lib/ext
Example:
javax.sql
3. Application Class Loader
Loads classes from the classpath.
Handles user-defined classes.
Example:
YourProject classes
Working of Class Loader (Delegation Model)
Java uses a parent-first delegation model:
1. Application Class Loader → asks Extension Loader
2. Extension Loader → asks Bootstrap Loader
3. If parent can’t load → child loads the class
This ensures security and avoids duplicate class loading.
Why Class Loader is Important?
Provides security
Supports dynamic class loading

Helps in modular Java applications
